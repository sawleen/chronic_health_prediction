# Classification of Patients at risk of Chronic Health Diseases
This project aims to predict patients at high-risk of suffering from chronic diseases in a telehealth firm and is based on real data provided by the partner firm. However this data is not uploaded publicly due to confidential reasons.

This is a group project as part of an NUS MTech EBAC course and would not have been possible without the contributions of my team mates.
