# chronic_health_prediction
This project aims to predict patients at high-risk of suffering from chronic diseases in a telehealth firm and is based on real data provided by the partner firm. However this data is not uploaded publicly due to confidential reasons.

This is a capstone project as part of my Masters project in NUS and would not have been possible without the contributions of my team mates.
